99\. [Spring 2024, Lab 0 PlatformIO Beta-Test](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece362/lab/lab0/) (No submission required, but must be completed by last lab session)
- To remove liquid/clean/late penalties, or simply to stand out in your TA application for next semester, you can help us out by beta-testing PlatformIO in VScode in our lab 0 for next semester.  
- Use your personal computers, not a lab machine.  
- Demonstrate that you can use PlatformIO in VScode to debug your C code, and that you can run C code on your microcontroller, debug it, and configure the UART to echo characters typed into the terminal.  
- After a successful demo, your GTA will remove all penalties.
