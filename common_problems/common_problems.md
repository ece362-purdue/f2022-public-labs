# Common Problems That You May Encounter in ECE36200

>**NOTE:** This is a living document, and will be updated continuously. If you have a weird issue that you run into that's not covered here, let us know and we can add the solution to it.

## Eclipse Issues
---
This is the category that you'll likely run into the most, so it's here at the top.

### Debug/Run: Connection reset error
This normally means that Eclipse is not able to reset your microcontroller. The most common problem for this is that the debugger is already running. Switch to the debug perspective (top right corner of your window, the bug icon), and press the red "terminate" button to close out the debugger.

### Debug/Run: Device already in use
This normally also occurs when your debugger is running a different program. As above, terminate your debug session.

### Debug/Run: Wrong or no device detected
This problem can have a couple of different culprits. Let's list them out:
- First, check your debugger connection chain. Everything (USB extender, STLINK V-2, 10-pin cable, devboard) should be connected securely. 
- Second, check and make sure both the red and green LEDs on your devboard are turned on. If they are not connected, typically this means a short, and parts of the devboard, breadboard, and 10-pin cable will heat up. First, unplug your devboard from your breadboard and try programming it again. If it programs when it's removed from the breadboard, there's a problem in your circuit, and you must find it before you plug it back in.
- If that doesn't work, you may have shorted 5V to 3V on accident, and then blown your microcontroller out. This is something to ask your lab coordinator about. For now, borrow a replacement board from the lab staff. Make sure to get this fixed and taken care of by your next lab section.
-  Next, check your STlink (the brightly colored plug). There should be a solid red or blue night that is not blinking. IF it's rapidly blinking, see "device already in use" a little further up. If it's slowly blinking red/blue (~1Hz), there is a problem with the STlink. Try unplugging and replugging firmly so everything is in place first, sometimes this is because of a bad connection. If that doesn't work, as your GTA for a replacement, and have them notify the lab coordinator that your debugger needs to be switched out.
-  If the STlink light does not turn on, or immedaitely turns off when programming, it's safe to assume that it needs to be replaced.
-  If none of this works, you've created a problem that we're unaware of. It may take a little while for us to figure it out, but we will help you figure it out.

### Debug/Run: OpenOCD not installed
If you get this error continually, this is a problem that you likely not be able to fix. Alert your GTA and lab cooridnator so they can get ECN to fix it.

### Build: Missing libraries
If you get a continual build error along the lines of "eclipse is missing a critical library, so it cannot build," this is a problem that you likely will not be able to fix. Alert your GTA and lab coordinator so they can get ECN to fix it.

### C editor not recognizing Standard Peripheral Library identities
Sometimes if you open up a project, you'll notice all of the normal CMSIS identities not being recognized. The first issue that this could be is that you didn't create the project correctly, and no firmware was included. The easiest way to get around this is to just build a new project, and dump all of your files in there.

If you know for a fact that you included the firmware library, you may have accidentally deleted the `#include <stm32f0xx.h>` that comes standard with any new main.c. In this case, type this into the top of your main.c and it should recognize your identities again. If this doesn't work, you do not have included firmawares.

## Firefox Issues
---

### Firefox claiming it can't be open in two locations
This is typically generated by someone using Thinlinc and forgetting to close Firefox. It happens. The easiest way to do this is to open your terminal and type in `firefox -p`, which is the Firefox profile manager. Inside of it, go ahead and delete any profiles in there. Once this is done, close the profile window and restart Firefox.

If this doesn't work, reopen the terminal and run the command `~ece270/bin/rmlocks`. That should just destroy anything locking it up.
